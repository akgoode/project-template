# project-template

### My personal template for projects

#### Dependencies
This comes with JQuery configured globally.  No need to `require('jquery')`.

1. Webpack
2. Webpack Dev Server
3. Babel (and assorted dependencies)

#### Dev-Server

To start dev server type:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Entry point for webpack is `scripts/index.js`.
Entry point for css is `stylesheets/index.css`

## Still a work in progress!
